# drug-discovery-model

Creating a Random Forrest ML Model based on ChEMBL data
The first file performs data cleansing to make the model more efficient
Then exploratory data analysis is performed using Pandas and NumPy as well as the calculation of Lipinski descriptors
The sci-kit learn library is used to create the Random Forrest ML model as well as the other ones for comparison
The model is then deployed through Streamlit for users to upload their own data
